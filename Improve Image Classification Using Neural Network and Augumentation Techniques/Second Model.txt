The Second model which I have implemented is the M-DA-0 model which consists of 6 Convolutional Layers Without any Data Augmentation Technique being used.
The Train and Test Accuracy that we obtained here are 99% and 82%.
 
This model pattern is three stacks of two convolutional layers followed by three max-pooling layers. 
The 3 filter numbers applied in the stacking convolutional layers slide from 32,64, and 128 separately. 
The flattened layer is used to adjust the feature maps to the dense layer with the probability output for ten classes.
I  also added Batch Normalization layers.
