The Second model which I have implemented is M-DA-0 model which consist of 6 Convolutional Layers Without any Data Augumentation Technique being used.
The Train and Test Accuracy that we obtained here is 99% and 82%.
 
This model pattern is three stacks of two convolutional layers followed by three max-pooling layer. 
The 3 filter numbers applied in the stacking convolutional layers slide from 32,64, 128 separately. 
The flatten layer is used to adjust the feature maps to the dense layer with the probability output for ten classes.
We also added Batch Normalization layers.
