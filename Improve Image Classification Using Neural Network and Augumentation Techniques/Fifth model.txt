The fifth model that I have implemented is the VGG-16-0 model which consists of 13 Convolutional Layers With no Data Augmentation Technique that we have used in fourth model Here, the gaussian noise is also  not added to the model.
The Train and Test Accuracy that we obtained here are 99% and 83%.
 
This model pattern is two stacks of two convolutional layers and three stacks of three convolution layers followed by five max-pooling layers. 
The 4 filter numbers applied in the stacking convolutional layers slide from 64, 128, 256, and 512 separately. 
The flattened layer is used to adjust the feature maps to the dense layer with the probability output for ten classes.
after the flattened and dense layer.
I  also added Batch Normalization layers.

The optimizer that I have used here is "Adamax" and the activation argument is "elu".
