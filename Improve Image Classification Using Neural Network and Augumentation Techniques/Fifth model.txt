The fifth model which I have implemented is the M-DA-3 model which consists of 6 Convolutional Layers With some extreme Data Augmentation Technique then used in fourth model Here, the gaussian noise is not added to the model .
The Train and Test Accuracy that we obtained here are 73% and 15%.
 
This model pattern is three stacks of two convolutional layers followed by three max-pooling layers. 
The 3 filter numbers applied in the stacking convolutional layers slide from 32,64, and 128 separately. 
The flattened layer is used to adjust the feature maps to the dense layer with the probability output for ten classes.
after the flatten and dense layer I have added some gaussian noise layer in the model
I  also added Batch Normalization layers and one dropout layer 

# I have done image pre-processing for extreme data augmentation as below in this model
# we will do some extreme image pre-processing for augmentation
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=45,  # randomly rotate images in the range (degrees, 0 to 180)
    width_shift_range=0.2,  # randomly shift images horizontally (fraction of total width)
    height_shift_range=0.2,  # randomly shift images vertically (fraction of total height)
    horizontal_flip=True,  # randomly flip images
    vertical_flip=False,# randomly flip images
    fill_mode='nearest',
    rescale=1./255,# multiply the data by the value provided
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,)
