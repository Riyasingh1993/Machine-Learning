The third model which I have implemented is the M-DA-1 model which consists of 6 Convolutional Layers With Data Augmentation Technique being used.
The Train and Test Accuracy that we obtained here are 96% and 88%.
 
This model pattern is three stacks of two convolutional layers followed by three max-pooling layers. 
The 3 filter numbers applied in the stacking convolutional layers slide from 32,64, and 128 separately. 
The flattened layer is used to adjust the feature maps to the dense layer with the probability output for ten classes.
I  also added Batch Normalization layers and one dropout layer 

# I have done image pre-processing for augmentation as below in this model
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,  # randomly rotate images in the range (degrees, 0 to 180)
    width_shift_range=0.1,  # randomly shift images horizontally (fraction of total width)
    height_shift_range=0.1,  # randomly shift images vertically (fraction of total height)
    horizontal_flip=True,  # randomly flip images
    vertical_flip=False)  # randomly flip images
