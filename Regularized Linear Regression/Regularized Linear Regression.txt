Implemented regularized linear regression and use grid search and 5-fold cross-validation to find the optimal value of the regularization coefficient. 

1. Used an existing library for algorithm implementation.

2. Used a library to clean up data. 

3. Used a library function to work with matrices. 

4. used a Airfoil self-noise dataset to test the regression function.
