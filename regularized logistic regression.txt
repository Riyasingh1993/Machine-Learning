Implemented regularized logistic regression and used grid search and 5-fold cross-validation to find the optimal value of the regularization coefficient. 

1. I have used existing library for algorithm implementation.

2. I have used a library to clean up data. 

3.I have used a library function to work with matrices. 

4. I have used breast cancer dataset.

5.Reported the performance of our algorithm using a confusion matrix.
